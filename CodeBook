Module 4 - Getting and Cleaning Data

1. Data Source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Processing Steps

#' 1. Downloads and extracts the UCI HAR Dataset if not already present
#' 2. Loads feature names and activity labels
#' 3. Reads training and test data sets
#' 4. Merges training and test data into a single data set
#' 5. Extracts only measurements on mean and standard deviation
#' 6. Uses descriptive activity names for activities in the data set
#' 7. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
#' 8. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject
#' 9. Writes the tidy data set to a file

3. Identifiers:

Subject: Subject identifier from 1 to 30
Activity: Activity performed 

4. Measurements
The tidy dataset contains measurement variables, showcasing mean and std values of the original data source and follow the pattern below:

names(extractedData) <- gsub("^t", "Time", names(extractedData))
names(extractedData) <- gsub("^f", "Frequency", names(extractedData))
names(extractedData) <- gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(extractedData))
names(extractedData) <- gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(extractedData))
names(extractedData) <- gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(extractedData))
names(extractedData) <- gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(extractedData))
names(extractedData) <- gsub("-mean\\(\\)", "Mean", names(extractedData))
names(extractedData) <- gsub("-std\\(\\)", "StdDev", names(extractedData))

5. Final Output

The final output of the assignment is a txt file called tidy_data
